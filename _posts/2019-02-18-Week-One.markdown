The first few weeks of the semester were establishing who the client was and what they were after. Adon supplied Renz and I with a booklet about the company, Enabling Love and their business decisions. I spent the first couple of sessions understanding what the client was wanting and working out how I was going to achieve it.

Enabling Love already have a website which was very useful as we had not been given much information. The booklet only contained marketing information and didn't really help us work out what exactly was needed.

The Login/Register page is good information as it told me that they already have an account system in place. This means that they have a database which we would need access to so we can work out existing users accounts.

Overall, the first week went well with the limited resources we had available.
