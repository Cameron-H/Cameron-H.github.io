My task for this week was to create a 'Tinder like' swiping cards for the Enabling Love app. This will be shown on the 4th screen on the navigation bar. The swiping card animation that I used is very similar to the one found on the popular dating app Tinder. They have picture of the person and you have the option or swiping towards the left to dislike or swipe to the right to like. They use green and red text to indicate whether you like liked that person or not. After you've swiped on a person, it shows the next person. This will be whoever wsi within a certain distance of the user.

This photot shows a small snipped if the code.

These photos show the cards swiping left or right. Test photos used are from Unsplash. This is working on my phone (Note 9).
