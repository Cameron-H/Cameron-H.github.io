I changed the default blue header bar to a light gray. The text also had to be changed as it was the wrong size and colour. I went with black text and re-aligned the text so it wouldn't look out of proportion.

To change the status bar colour I had to import the StatusBar library, I then called it within the Header tag. The colour is set to the same colour as the header bar (#d9d9d9). I also had to change the colour of the status bar icons. By default, they are white. This wouldn't work with my colour change as it's close to white. Changing them to the dark setting makes it contrast nicely with the new background colour.

Having the status bar the same colour as the background colour of the app makes the app feel modern and clean. Status bar icons are also really easy to see.
