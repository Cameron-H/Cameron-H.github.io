A person frome the DevOPS team came through with a prompt reply including the details for a new server that I can use.

I started working on it during the mid semester break. The web and database server is going to be used for holding user information for testing. We don't know what the current server situation that Enabling Love has got. So we can keep moving forward, the team and I thought it would be a good idea to set up a local server just for testing purposes.
