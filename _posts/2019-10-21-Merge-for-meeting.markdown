During the two week mid semester break, I emailed Josh to set up a meeting to update him on what we've done on the application. My sprint for the week was to merge Renz and I's work. 
We decided to use my project as the main project as I had done a lot of design stuff and I thought it would be easier to add the functionality on top of what I've done.

Work merged:
- Profile page
- Date picker change
- Designs 

The reason for this merge was due to a meeting that Josh and I had organised to show him what we had done on the app so far. The meeting went well and he was heppy with the progress.
