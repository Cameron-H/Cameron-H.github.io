The work that Renz did on the basic navigation/layout for the app is good but I noticed something was missing from the side menu that is in the design that the design students made.
That is the profile picture which is circular.

After doing some research, I found that it wasn't that much code to add. When Renz and I get access to the database to add users, the hardcoded images will be replaced with the profile images that the user will add on when they create their profile.
