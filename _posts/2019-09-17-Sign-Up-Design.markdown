Sign up page design consisted of removing the background image of our current app, making the text boxes white with black text (Same as login) and give everything but the text a drop shadow (elevation). The enabling love logo was added at the top with the form fields below. A keyboard avoiding view allowing the user to view what they're typing into the fields. The sign up button is very similar to the Login page button,only smaller to accomodate more inputs. 

Repetition unifies and strengthens a design so that's why I chose to keep the same theme as the login page. Title and logo on top with the form underneath.

I made the layout as simple as possible so it makes signing up a quick and seamless task.
