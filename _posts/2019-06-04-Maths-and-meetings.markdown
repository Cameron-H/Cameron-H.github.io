Renz, Grayson and I went to a meeting with the client and design students to discuss the website and app design. 

After waiting for weeks, we finally got the designs for the app from the design students. Now that we have an idea of what we're doing, we can progress to getting the core functionality of the app working. 

Adon told me to work on figuring out how to find points within a circle and how to convert latitute and longitude coordinates to distance in kilometers. After doing some reseaching I found some stack overflow sites that helped solve this problem, I noted the basics of how it works in the photo below.
