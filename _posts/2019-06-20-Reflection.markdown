In my opinion, I think that I did okay considering the circumstances. The set backs that I were understanding API requests, switching to React Native and waiting on app designs. The semester started off slow with just planning on what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. As the semester progressed, I worked on getting API requests working,google maps, and creating a backend for our app. Bearing in mind that, we hadn't had a meeting with the client yet and the designs students weren't starting the design of the app until after the mid semester break. Around that time we also got told that we should stop using Android Studio (Java) and use React Native. The idea of using React instead made sense but neither Renz and I had any idea of how it worked. So we had to self learn it as the semester went on. This resulted in a simple but nice looking nagivation app and Tinder like card swiping. The first meeting we had was in April so we've had enough time to work out what the client wants and start to get a plan in place. But of course, it's one step at a time, especially using an unfamiliar language like React.

So to summerise, I think I did well at the end but development was slow when we got told to change languages. For next time, I want to try and not stress out and get overwhelmed when I encounter something I have never seen before. I always look for the hardest stuff first but I need to take my time and start from the beginning. What we have so far is a start and I definitely didn't think I'd get this far using React. Also, waiting weeks for the app designs was definitely a set back that could have been easily solved. I've learned for next semester that I should be open to trying new things, even if they sound preposterous. Now that we have the designs and have spoken to the client, we have a direction and a goal. 

Getting the design files at the end of the semester..  (Grayson has yet to receive the Figma files)
