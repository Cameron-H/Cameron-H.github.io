The semester starts off with Grayson and I discussing what needs to be done throughout the semester. This involved creating a Kanban board on our repo located on Gitlab. The below photo shows the ten tickets that need to be completed by the end of the semester. Renz and I could choose to work on any of the tickets with a reasonable sprint deadline of one or two weeks. This week I also chose my first ticket to work on next week which was look at implementing Firebase into the app.
