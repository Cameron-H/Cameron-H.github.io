The second and third week of Project One was to create a simple application that would have Google Maps, displaying your current location. It worked but it was pretty buggy using the emulator. Didn't have much luck on my phone either. Samsung's security software, Knox, stopped the app from loading everytime I tried to launch it.

I created a GitLab repository that Renz and I could use for deveopment on the app. I told Renz that he should just push his version of the basic maps app as his was stable and had more functionality.
